# How to install Python

<!-- easter egg cachÃ©

First of all, there are several ways to install your python environment on your Windows computer, the following tutorial is just one setting that I find easy and clean enough to use.

## Prior installation

### Terminal

The default terminal in Windows is not that good to code, I don't recommend using it. To replace it, I advise you to install [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/). It won't install you just a new terminal but also Git (code versionning software, required to use GitHub or GitLab among other things).

*Note: Accept all default parameters during installation (it sould be fine... your computer might crash but it's all part of the process ;D)*

### Miniconda

Although you could install python directly on your computer, I have found it best to use [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) as it comes with several attractive features like virtual environment management (we will come to that later). Download the only installer name `Miniconda3 Windows 64-bit` for Windows 

*Note: Accept all default parameters during installation.*
